###About
This is a quick game I wrote this week for the Midsummer Jam Week.

You play as an IT worker in the International Security Agency. You are trying to handle and review the ever expanding amounts of data. Your job is to find bad guys.

Nothing in this game is real, nor has any correlation to any outside events.
