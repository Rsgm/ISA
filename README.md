#ISA: Operation Shapes


###About
This is a quick game I am writing this week for the Midsummer Jam Week. The themes are growth and secrets, they fit perfectly.  
You play as an IT worker in the International (Security or Surveillance, I haven't decided yet) Agency. You are trying to handle and review the ever expanding amounts of data.

Nothing in this game is real, nor has any correlation to any outside events.

More to come.
