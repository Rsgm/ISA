#ISA: Operation Shapes


###About
This is a quick game I am writing this week for the Midsummer Jam Week.
You play as an IT worker in the International (Security or Surveillance, I haven't decided yet) Agency.

Nothing in this game is real, nor has any correlation to any outside events.

More to come.
